# SwapSortV2
SwapSort that's slightly less garbage. 

TODO:
High priority:
*Make bubblesort bidirectional
*Optimize swapsort to only operate on the necisary indices (end indices become unnecisary after a pass of bidirectional bubblesort)

Low priority:
*Impliment multithreading on swapsort subsections
*Find some creative way to reduce branching
*See if there's any way the algorithem could be further optimized for caching


I have a Medium blog post on the development of this project that can be found here: https://medium.com/@twof/on-the-optimization-of-bubble-sort-e1096d93d478#.ieqe9gnu8
